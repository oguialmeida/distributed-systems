## How distributed systems work?
This repository was made for the subject of distributed systems and aims to show how a computer uses computational resources at several different computing hubs to achieve a common and shared goal. This demonstration will be done through exercises written in Python.


## Some observations

Is possible that there are some variables and comments written in Portuguese, as this repository is for personal study, I did not find it necessary to translate. But feel free to review and use the code :)
